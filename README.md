Trained on a diverse dataset encompassing diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart attack, DocBot is tailored to provide valuable insights and engaging responses in the field of health.

## Model Architecture

DocBot's brain is powered by a neural network implemented using PyTorch. The model architecture comprises three layers:

- **Input Layer:** The initial layer processes the input data.
  
- **Hidden Layers:** Two hidden layers follow, enhancing the model's ability to capture intricate patterns.

- **Output Layer:** The final layer produces the model's predictions.

The ReLU activation function is applied between layers to introduce non-linearity, crucial for the model's learning capabilities.
